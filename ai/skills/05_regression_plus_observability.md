# Skill: Regression And Observability

## Purpose
Add regression coverage and minimal observability only when it improves confidence.

## Inputs
- Fix Notes
- Test strategy
- Logging or metrics guidelines

## Steps
1. Add or expand regression tests where coverage is thin.
2. Add minimal logs or metrics at entry, error, or state change points if needed.
3. Verify tests remain deterministic.

## Outputs
- Regression Coverage artifact describing tests added.
- Observability Notes artifact if any logging or metrics were added.
