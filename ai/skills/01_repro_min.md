# Skill: Repro Or Acceptance Criteria

## Purpose
Establish a minimal, deterministic reproduction of a bug or define clear acceptance criteria for a feature.

## Inputs
- Bug report or feature request
- Environment details
- Expected vs actual behavior

## Steps
1. Identify the smallest input and path that triggers the behavior.
2. Prefer a failing test; if not possible, document a deterministic manual repro.
3. Capture evidence of the failure.

## Outputs
- Repro Notes artifact with steps, inputs, and evidence.
- Acceptance Criteria list when the task is a feature.
